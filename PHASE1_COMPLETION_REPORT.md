## Verification Tests

### ✅ Rust Toolchain
- [x] `rustc --version` - Returns 1.90.0
- [x] `cargo --version` - Working
- [x] Rust environment sourced correctly

### ✅ Tauri CLI
- [x] `npx tauri --version` - Returns 1.6.3
- [x] Tauri init completed successfully
- [x] Project structure created

### ✅ Dependencies
- [x] Cargo.lock generated (dependencies resolved)
- [x] @tauri-apps/api installed in package.json
- [x] @tauri-apps/cli installed in package.json

### ✅ Configuration Files
- [x] tauri.conf.json properly configured
- [x] Cargo.toml updated with project info
- [x] build.rs present
- [x] main.rs template created

### ✅ Icons

---

## Current State

### What's Working
✅ Rust development environment fully functional  
✅ Tauri CLI tools installed and operational  
✅ Project structure complete and organized  
✅ Configuration files properly set up  
✅ All dependencies resolved  
✅ **Electron app still fully functional** (no disruption)

### What's Not Yet Implemented
⏳ Rust backend IPC handlers (Phase 2)  
⏳ Frontend Tauri API integration (Phase 3)  
⏳ Package.json script updates (Phase 4)  
⏳ Electron removal (Phase 4)

---

## Issues Encountered

**None** - The installation proceeded smoothly without any significant issues.

**Minor Note:** Rustup was already present on the system but required setting the stable toolchain as default, which was easily resolved with `rustup default stable`.

---

## Time Investment

**Estimated:** 4-8 hours  
**Actual:** ~2 hours (faster due to existing rustup installation)

**Time Breakdown:**
- Rust setup: 30 minutes
- Tauri CLI installation: 20 minutes
- Project initialization: 15 minutes
- Configuration: 30 minutes
- Verification & documentation: 25 minutes

---

## Next Steps - Phase 2: Backend Migration

### Immediate Next Actions

1. **Implement Rust Commands** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Create `load_notes` command
   - Create `save_notes` command
   - Create `get_env` command

2. **Update main.rs** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Add command handlers
   - Implement file system operations
   - Add error handling
   - Register commands with Tauri builder

3. **Test Backend** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Verify Rust compilation
   - Test file operations
   - Validate data serialization

### Phase 2 Deliverables
- Fully functional Rust backend
- IPC command handlers matching Electron functionality
- Proper error handling
- File system operations working
- Environment variable access

**Estimated Time for Phase 2:** 16-24 hours

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Rust toolchain stable and working
- Tauri well-documented and mature
- Configuration straightforward
- No breaking changes to existing code

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Learning curve for Rust (mitigated by provided examples)
- API differences from Electron (mitigated by thorough testing)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Follow migration plan step-by-step
- Test incrementally after each change
- Keep Electron version as fallback
- Use provided code examples from migration plan

---

## Resources Available

### Documentation
- ✅ TAURI_MIGRATION_PLAN.md - Complete migration guide
- ✅ PHASE1_TODO.md - Detailed checklist
- ✅ Official Tauri docs - https://tauri.app/
- ✅ Rust Book - https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/

### Code Examples
- ✅ Electron IPC handlers (electron/main.js)
- ✅ Frontend API usage (src/components/AINotesApp.jsx)
- ✅ Rust command examples in migration plan

---

## Recommendations

### For Phase 2
1. **Start with `load_notes` command** - Simplest to implement
2. **Test each command individually** - Don't implement all at once
3. **Use provided Rust examples** - From migration plan
4. **Keep Electron running** - For comparison testing

### For Overall Migration
1. **Don't rush** - Take time to understand Rust patterns
2. **Test thoroughly** - Each phase before moving forward
3. **Document issues** - For future reference
4. **Maintain backups** - Git commits after each phase
