## What Was NOT Tested

Due to the nature of the build process, the following were not tested:

1. **Application Launch Test** - The actual running of the AppImage
2. **DEB Package Creation** - Only AppImage was created (DEB target may need additional configuration)
3. **Application Functionality** - UI, AI features, voice recording, etc.
4. **Cross-platform Builds** - Only Linux build was tested

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use:
1. ✅ The AppImage in Downloads is ready to run
2. ✅ No installation required - just execute the file
3. ✅ All documentation is available for reference

### For Future Improvements:
1. Add DEB package build target configuration if needed
2. Test the application functionality after launch
3. Consider code signing for distribution
4. Add automated testing for application features

1. `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete installation and troubleshooting guide
2. `QUICK_BUILD_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference for building and running
3. `BUILD_TEST_RESULTS.md` - This file (test results summary)

### Scripts:
