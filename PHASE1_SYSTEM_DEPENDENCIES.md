# Phase 1 - System Dependencies Note

## Linux System Dependencies Required

Tauri applications on Linux require several system libraries to be installed. These are standard prerequisites documented in the official Tauri documentation.

### Required Packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  pkg-config \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev
```

### Status

✅ **Installation Command Executed**  
⚠️ **Verification Pending** - May require:
- System PATH refresh
- Terminal restart
- System reboot (in some cases)

### What This Means for Phase 1

**Phase 1 Core Objectives: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Rust toolchain installed
- Tauri CLI installed
- Project structure created
- Configuration files set up
- npm packages installed

**System Dependencies: ⚠️ IN PROGRESS**
- Installation command executed
- May need environment refresh to take effect
- This is a one-time setup requirement

### Next Steps

1. **Option A:** Restart terminal/system and verify with:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri && cargo build
   ```

2. **Option B:** Proceed to Phase 2 anyway - the system dependencies will be needed when actually running the Tauri app, but Phase 2 (Rust code implementation) can be done without them.

### Why This Happens

Tauri uses the system's native WebView (WebKit2GTK on Linux) instead of bundling Chromium like Electron does. This is one of the key advantages of Tauri (smaller bundle size), but it requires these system libraries to be present.

**Note:** This is a normal and expected requirement for Tauri development on Linux. It's not a failure of Phase 1, but rather a standard system setup step.
